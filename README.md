# Sorting-Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.

## Basic Sorting Algorithms
- bubble sort
- merge sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- quick sort

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

### Merge Sort
Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

### Selection Sort
selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

### Quick Sort
Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. In efficient implementations it is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.
